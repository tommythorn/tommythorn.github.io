                   Nascom 2 emulator in Javascript

In brief, the minimal goal is to be able to fully support all the
Nascom 2 software on nascomhomepage.com which would run on an standard
Nascom 2 (except for a memory extension).

The Z80 emulator is borrowed from JSSpeccy, but the rest
has be written from scratch.

Current features:
* Emulates: Z80, RAM, ROM, display, keyboard(*), serial IO
* Loading of NAS files as well as "tapes"
* Saving to tape
* [Persistent state currently broken]

(*) Keyboard support is interesting for a couple of reasons. Since
there isn't a perfect mapping between "standard" PC 101 keyboards and
the Nascom keyboard, for some applications it may be more appropriate
to treat the keys more "physically". For example, shift-0 is ')' on
the US version of the PC 101 keyboard, where it's the "up-arrow" on
the Nascom, taking the ASCII code of the caret '^'.  Generally for
games the physical layout would make more sense.

This is work in progress and contributions are most welcome.
